# EasyLink for Obsidian

**Find and create links to similar notes, effortlessly.**

EasyLink supercharges your note-linking workflow. Instead of manually searching for related ideas, simply select a phrase or sentence, run the command, and get an instant, ranked list of the most relevant content from your entire vault.

---

## Key Features

-   **Intelligent, Contextual Search**: Finds similar content based on shared keywords, not just exact text matches.
-   **Relevance Scoring**: Ranks results with a similarity score (%) so you can immediately identify the most relevant content.
-   **Precise Linking**: Creates wiki-links directly to specific headings or blocks, not just the file.
-   **Quick Access**: Trigger a search with a single click on the ribbon icon or via the command palette.
-   **Open in New Tab**: Hold `Ctrl/Cmd` and click a result to open the source note in a new tab instead of inserting a link.
-   **Highly Customizable**:
    -   Exclude specific folders (like templates or archives) from search results.
    -   Adjust the maximum number of results to show.
    -   Set a minimum similarity score to filter out noise and fine-tune relevance.

## How to Use

1.  **Select Text**: Highlight a word, phrase, or sentence in your note that you want to find connections for.
2.  **Run Command**:
    -   Click the **link icon** in the left ribbon.
    -   OR, open the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`) and run the command `EasyLink: Find similar content for selection`.
3.  **Review Results**: A pop-up modal will appear with a list of similar content, sorted by the highest relevance score.
4.  **Choose an Action**:
    -   **To Insert a Link**: Click on any item in the list. A perfectly formatted link (`[[Note#Heading|Your Selected Text]]`) will be inserted at your cursor's position.
    -   **To Open the Note**: Hold `Ctrl` (on Windows/Linux) or `Cmd` (on macOS) and click an item. The note will open directly in a new tab for quick reference.
